    <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
            <h2>Socioeconomic Status</h2>
            <p>Families with limited financial resources face barriers such as the inability to afford school supplies and extracurricular activities. Housing instability can lead to frequent school changes, disrupting learning.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <h2>Geographic Location</h2>
            <p>Children in rural or underserved urban areas often have limited access to nearby schools. Long commutes may be unsafe, and schools may lack resources, adequate facilities, and technology.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <h2>Insufficient Funding</h2>
            <p>Many low-income schools receive inadequate funding, resulting in larger class sizes, outdated materials, and insufficient support staff. This can hinder personalized attention from teachers, negatively affecting student outcomes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <h2>Teacher Shortages</h2>
            <p>A shortage of qualified teachers can lead to classrooms being staffed by inexperienced or poorly trained educators. High turnover rates and instability can disrupt continuity in studentsâ€™ education.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <h2>Systemic Inequalities</h2>
            <p>Historical discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or disability creates disparities in educational access. Marginalized communities may experience lower funding, biased disciplinary practices, and a lack of culturally relevant curricula, affecting student engagement.</p>
